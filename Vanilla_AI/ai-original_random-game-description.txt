ai-original_random-game

These files are a functioning version of the ai script files shipped with Star Wars:Galactic Battlegrounds.  They were extracted from file gamedata.drs shipped with SW:GB version 1.0.  (File gamedata.drs did not change in version 1.1)   The extracted scripts themselves are the copyrighted property of Lucas Arts and are used here within the terms of the SW:GB license. 

There are 55 ai script files in gamedata.drs, with file ids from 60001 to 60055.  Internally, the files refer to each other by name, rather than by file id.  However, the names are not specified in gamedata.drs, but only by reference in the scripts themselves.  File 60037 is the root script, and calls all the other scripts.  Files 60012 (deathmatch) and 60018 (diplomacy) also call other scripts.

Many script files shipped in gamedata.drs are not used by the computer player. They and appear to have been used during development for testing the game.   Any feedback as to what these files are doing in the game currently will be appreciated.

All the shipped file names have had "ai-original_" prefixed to the original file name to avoid file name conflicts with the computer player.  In the scripts themselves, I have prefixed "ai-original\ai-original_" to the module names.  Again, this was done to keep the names distinct from the file names used by the computer player, and to keep the AI folder relatively clean.  All script files are placed in directory ai-original, except for the root script file and the ai suffix file.  

To add this computer player to your installed copy of SW:GB, unzip the downloaded file into directory AI in the GAME directory of Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds, or copy the files named ai-original_random-game.per, ai-original_random-game.ai, and directory ai-original and its contents to folder AI as above.  When running the game, you should see another player named 'ai-original_random-game" added to the list of Other Players available to play Standard Games in Single Player mode.

This computer player has been tested only in Random Map game mode.  It "should" perform identically to the shipped computer player.  With all scripts available, one can now modify the shipped computer player 'til one's heart is content.  :-)

Any errors or omissions in the scripts provided here are solely my responsibility.  Please send feedback to IdLe_WorkeR at tucpchom@gte.net
